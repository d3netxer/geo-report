# GeoReport Template

TEST1

A simple template for experimenting with geographic reports: reports with embedded geographic information.  Uses [Jekyll Static Site Generator](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) to manage report content.  Maps are built with leaflet.js/mapbox.js.  **GeoReport** was built as an open source report editing platform for the CrowdCover [Moabi Project](http://rdc.moabi.org).  See [an example report](http://rdc.moabi.org/redd_risk/en/).
